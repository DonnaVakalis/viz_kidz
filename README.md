# viz_kidz
analysis of kids' baby connect data from age 0 to 1 (so far!). There are lots of apps that allow you to track diapers, milk consumption and growth. But other than internal built-in visualizations of this dataset, there isn't a built-in way to interrogate the data... nor produce a fun 'annual report' of all their accomplishments :)  Enter viz_kidz!
